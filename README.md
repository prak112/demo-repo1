Trying to understand the World of Git
More I see the less I know...

## confusion prevails..
watching tutorials and practicing..

## next steps to understand GitHub better
1. Open test.html file in browser
2. Check out how cool or ugly it is

## branching
1. check for branches in master
2. create branch with descriptive title of task
3. play with data
4. check changes between branch and master
